# German Class ðŸ“˜

Welcome to my **German Class** repository! This repo is a collection of lessons I've learned during my **German A1 course** and from my German textbook.

The goal of this project is to:
- **Share knowledge** with others who are also learning German (A1 level).
- **Digitally store** what I learn in a structured way for easy review and reference.

Whether you're just starting your journey with German or need a refresher, I hope you find these lessons useful!
